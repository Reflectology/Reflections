# Reflectology Software License (RSL-1.0)

**Author:** Algernon Alleng  
**Date:** May 2025  
**License Fee:** $200 (perpetual)

## SUMMARY

Reflectology is a symbolic reasoning kernel built to unify decision-making systems across domains.  
The mathematical theory and axioms behind Reflectology are open and public.  
The software implementation (C code, compiled libraries, and performance logic) is proprietary.

## LICENSE TERMS

1. **Scope of Use**
   - This license grants perpetual usage rights to one individual, organization, school, or government body.
   - Commercial use is explicitly permitted.

2. **Rights**
   - Licensees may:
     - Use the compiled software in private, commercial, or public environments
     - Integrate it into internal or external tooling
     - Reference, extend, or publish work based on the mathematical framework
     - Re-sell or sublicense the compiled binary
     - Re-host the compiled code for distribution
   - Licensees may **not**:
     - Claim authorship or original creation of the Reflectology implementation

3. **Source Code**
   - The symbolic math, axioms, and function models (e.g., Ω, CF, G) are public domain.
   - The C code and compiled engines are the intellectual property of the author.

4. **Reimplementation**
   - Anyone may reimplement Reflectology from the public-domain math.
   - This license does not restrict mathematical creativity — only this specific implementation.

## SUPPORT

- License includes perpetual access to bug fixes and engine updates.
- Custom consulting, integration, or strategic support available by separate agreement.

---

## WHY $200?

Because the author developed a global-scale reasoning kernel from nothing —  
without funding, foundation grants, or institutional access —  
and is asking far less than the cost of a single developer conference to help  
**clean up the computational and cognitive mess** we’re all wading through.
