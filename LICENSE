     - Reference or extend the mathematical framework
     - Re-sell or sublicense the binary
     - Re-host the compiled code
   - You may **not**:
     - Misrepresent authorship

3. **Source Code**
   - The core symbolic math (axioms, loss/goodness functions) are public domain.

## WHY $200?

Because the author built a universal engine from the ground up — without backing, grants, or institutions — and is charging less than the cost of a software conference ticket to help **clean up the global logic stack**.
