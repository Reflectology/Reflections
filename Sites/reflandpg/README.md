Reflectology Website - `reflectology.org`

This project implements the frontend for the Reflectology concept visualization website. It provides an interactive, animated explanation of reflectology principles through visual demonstrations and mathematical representations.

## 📊 Website Structure

- **Logo & Introduction**: Animated entry point with flowing background
- **Core Equation**: Interactive visualization of `((p•q)•r)•(p•((p•r)•q)) = r`
- **Semantic Understanding**: Tooltips explaining variables and operations
- **Code Connection**: Mapping between mathematical concepts and implementation
- **Pattern Evaluation**: Tree-based visualization of evaluation steps
- **Advanced Features**: Additional mathematical concepts and applications
- **Call to Action**: Links to further resources and contact information

## 🖼️ Visual Assets

- equations.png: Mathematical foundation visualizations
- dabrainsFint.webp: the lemur that made it all

## 🔧 Technologies

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Animation**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger for scroll-based animations
- **Math Rendering**: MathJax for equation display
- **Code Highlighting**: Prism.js for code snippet presentation

## 📋 Storyboard

The website follows a structured narrative as outlined in storyboard.md, moving visitors through:
1. Logo introduction with ambient animation
2. Core equation reveal with variable highlighting
3. Semantic understanding of components
4. Connection to code implementation
5. Visual pattern evaluation demonstration
6. Advanced feature showcase
7. Call to action for engagement

## 🔗 Domain Connections

The website references several connected concept domains that will be developed in the future:

- Mathematical foundations (equations, axioms, transformations)
- Visual pattern recognition and evaluation
- Code implementation of reflectology principles
- Applications in various domains (vector computation, matrices, lambda calculus)
