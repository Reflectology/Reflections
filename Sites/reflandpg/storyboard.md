- Background: Dark with subtle flowing math symbols
- Action: REFLECTΘLΘGY text appears letter by letter with subtle glow
- Audio: Soft electronic "thinking" sound

## Scene 2: Equation Reveal (0:05-0:15)
- Background: Continues from Scene 1
- Action: Core equation ((p•q)•r)•(p•((p•r)•q)) = r appears as if being written
- Animation: Variables p, q, r bounce slightly when completed

- Audio: Code typing sounds, connection "clicks"

## Scene 5: Pattern Evaluation (0:40-0:55)
- Background: Abstract network pattern

## Scene 6: Advanced Features (0:55-1:05)
- Background: Grid with math symbols
- Action: Four panels showing different computational aspects
- Animation: Each panel pops in with its own mini-animation
- Audio: Short "whoosh" for each feature reveal

## Scene 7: Call to Action (1:05-1:15)
