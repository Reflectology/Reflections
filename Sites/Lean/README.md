# LeanProject

## Overview

LeanProject is a mathematical framework designed around three core components:

1. **Infinite Random Engine (IRE)**:
   - Generates all potential solutions or configurations (\( \Omega \)).
   - \( \Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \dots, \omega_n \} \).

2. **Computational Group Theory (CGT)**:
   - Uses group theory to reduce symmetry and group equivalencies.
   - \( \text{Orbit}(\omega) = \{ g \cdot \omega \,|\, g \in G \} \), where \( G \) is the symmetry group on \( \Omega \).

3. **Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA)**:
   - Optimizes configurations using a localized "goodness" function via positive and negative passes:
     - **Compute FFA**: \( CF(\omega) = \arg \min_{g \in G} f(g \cdot \omega) \)
     - **Evaluate FFA**: \( G(\omega) = \text{Utility} - \text{Cost} \)
     - **Optimize FFA**: \( \omega^* = \arg \max_{\omega \in CF(\Omega)} G(\omega) \)

## Core Principles

- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Includes measure-theoretic, topological, and algebraic properties to ensure mathematical rigor.
  - Provides completeness, connectedness, separability, and normalized measures.

- **Symmetry Reduction**:
  - Implements group actions to reduce redundant configurations.
  - Ensures measure-preserving transformations.

- **Optimization**:
  - Balances utility and cost to identify optimal configurations.
  - Incorporates the symmetry-flow-force associativity rule:
    \( ((pq)r)((p(pr)q)) = r \).

## Practical Implementation

- **Finite Configuration Spaces**:
  - Enables computation over finite subsets of \( \Omega \).
  - Computes canonical forms and identifies optimal configurations using FFA.

- **Goodness Function**:
  - \( G = \theta(\Omega) - C \), where \( \theta \) measures utility and \( C \) measures cost.

## Applications

This framework is suitable for:
- Physics simulations
- AI training and optimization
- Scheduling and resource allocation
- Cryptographic algorithms
- Game theory and state exploration
